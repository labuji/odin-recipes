  <p>
    There's just something delightfully addictive about this special combination of cold and spicy.
    This recipe is the perfect catchall for all those summer
    vegetables we're supposed to be eating more of, as well as any dry leftover chicken you have around.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>½ cup ranch dressing</li>
    <li>¼ cup reduced-fat sour cream</li>
    <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix, divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon mild chunky salsa</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
    <li>8 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
    <li>shredded lettuce</li>
    <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
    <li>4 green onions, sliced</li>
    <li>1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives</li>
    <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced (Optional)</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine ranch dressing, sour cream, 1 teaspoon taco seasoning, and salsa in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate
      until serving.</li>
    <li>Toss chicken with remaining taco seasoning. Cover bowl loosely with wax paper or plastic wrap. Microwave chicken
      until chicken is heated through, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Warm tortillas in a skillet for about a minute on each side to make them pliable. Place a scoop of chicken on
      the tortilla and top with lettuce, tomato, green onion, olives, avocado, cheese, and a spoonful of the ranch
      dressing mixture.</li>
  </ol>
